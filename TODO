Tests

Iterator:
iterator on cfg and worklist with abstract values // WIP
interval domain implementation

CFG:
Probably do lazy cfg construction at some point (why did I start this project? I haven't even started the main thing and i already have 10000 things to do ahah. Knew I should have been a woodcutter)

To have any useful results:
Implement memory layout abstraction
Implement domain to manipulate integers and pointers the same way
interval domain
Reduced product of all of the above
