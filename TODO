CFG:
iterator on cfg and worklist with abstract values
interval domain implementation

Take a look at std::pmr::unsynchronized_pool_resource for allocation of data (ssa is great for analysis but creates a lot of information)

De-recursivise my funcs

Probably do lazy cfg construction at some point (why did I start this project? I haven't even started the main thing and i already have 10000 things to do ahah. Knew I should have been a woodcutter)
